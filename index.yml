author: Alexander Wang, Daniel Ogunkunle, Krupa Patel
abstract: This study delves into the regulatory effects of alprazolam, a common benzodiazepine, on the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and its implications for stress and anxiety management. By employing mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis, we explore the intricate interactions and feedback mechanisms  within the HPA axis componentsâ€”CRH, ACTH, and cortisol. Alprazolam induces significant changes in the dynamics of cortisol production and its feedback control, suggesting a potential therapeutic mechanism in the treatment of anxiety disorders.
